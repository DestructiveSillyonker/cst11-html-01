# Introduction to HTML Editing with Github

Github is a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and it can be used for coding a variety of programming languages.  In addition, we can use it to create pages in HTML.  Before we begin, we will need to install a few extensions to help us out

# Extensions
Open up the *Extensions* from the activity bar. This functions like the Google Chrome Extension marketplace where you can add extensions to customize VSC or add functionality for specific languages.
We will be installing the following extensions for use with this unit on HTML:
1. Beautify
2. Preview in browser
3. Live Server

Note that every extension has settings that you should review when you are installing them to make sure that they are correct for you.  Preview in browser, for example needs to have the correct browser (or default browser) identifed

# Beautify
Source code is the stuff you type in to make something work.  We will consider even the stuff you need to make html documents work as source code.
Once you have installed the extensions, open the "page1.html" document.
